DÛM RUNNER is a Doom inspired roguelike, designed for LAN and online play, with fast paced, twitch shooter action, base building elements, and AI generated encounters, enemies, weapons and maps.

Build OUTPOSTS to support your RUNNERS

RUNNERS go into the DUNGEONS OF DÛM to claim resources, capture minions, and conquer territory.

OUTPOST CAPTAINS plan, build, and run OUTPOSTS

OUTPOSTS get attacked by marauding bands of MONSTERS, and RIVAL LEGIONS, so they must be built to withstand assault. 

Defenses include WALLS, TURRETS, and MINIONS.

RUNNERS and CAPTAINS can also scour the OVERWORLD LANDSCAPE for loot and resources, as well assault or trade with RIVAL LEGIONS.

OUTPOSTS can upgrade and RESEARCH new tools, weapons, armor, and technology to aid RUNNERS, CAPTAINS, and the OUTPOSTS themselves.
